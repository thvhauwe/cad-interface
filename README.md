### 8. CONTACTING THE AUTHOR(s)
---------------------------

We would very much appreciate hearing from you if you use `cad-interface` and find problems,
or if you can think of ways it could be improved - and even (or is that
'especially'?) if you just think it's great. Even if the facility you would
like to see appears to be of interest only to you, tell us about it - you'd be
surprised how many ideas in that class have a much wider appeal.

See above for further contact information.

We read and consider all mail we receive, even though we may not have time
to reply.
